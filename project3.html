      <h2>Drone Arm</h2>
      <p>In this project, I created an arm for a drone showcasing advanced skills in SolidWorks, emphasizing both structural integrity and lightweight optimization. The model utilizes 2D sketching to define the arm’s intricate geometry, ensuring precise placement of key components such as the motor mount and attachment points. The use of extrude and cut features was critical in creating the arm’s complex, lattice-style framework, which reduces material weight while maintaining strength. The lattice structure was designed using patterning tools to replicate triangular cutouts, demonstrating efficient use of space and material through design optimization. Loft operations were applied to create smooth transitions between the arm’s varying cross-sectional profiles, ensuring aerodynamic efficiency and structural continuity. </p>
