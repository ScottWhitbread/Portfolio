      <h2>2D FEA Analysis of Nut & Bolt</h2>
      <p>In this project, I conducted a 2D Finite Element Analysis (FEA) on a bolt and nut assembly using Ansys Mechanical, with a focus on understanding stress distribution and the effects of preload forces. The goal was to accurately simulate the assembly's behavior under various load conditions to assess structural integrity and identify potential failure points. Starting by creating a 2D axisymmetric model in Ansys, I defined material properties, boundary conditions, and applied loads that replicate the typical operating conditions of the bolt-nut assembly. Special attention was given to the contact interactions between the bolt and nut threads, where I defined appropriate frictional contact settings and refined the mesh to capture realistic stress distribution at the contact points.</p>
