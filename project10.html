      <h2>FMA IA 58 Pucará Surface Design</h2>
      <p>In this project, I created a surface model for a FMA IA 58 Pucará with the focus on crafting the aerodynamic surfaces of the Pucará aircraft, including the fuselage, wings and tail. I designed the fuselage by creating reference points and spline curves that defined the aircraft's overall shape. Using the Multi-Sections Surface tool, I was able to generate a streamlined fuselage surface with controlled transitions between profiles, maintaining both structural integrity and aerodynamic smoothness. The wing and tail design was approached by first defining airfoil profiles along the wingspans then employing the Sweep and Blend tools to create a smooth, aerodynamic surface across these profiles.</p>
