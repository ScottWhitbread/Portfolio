      <h2>Belt Pulley</h2>
      <p>In this project, I created a belt drive pulley in SolidWorks which showcases advanced modeling skills. The design process began with 2D sketching, utilizing SolidWorks tools to define the geometry of the wheel's spokes, rim, and hub. Revolve and extrude features were then applied to transform 2D sketches into detailed 3D components, ensuring the wheel's structure was both functional and aesthetically balanced. Circular patterning was employed to symmetrically distribute the spokes around the hub, demonstrating proficiency in SolidWorks' patterning tools for efficient and precise modeling. </p>
